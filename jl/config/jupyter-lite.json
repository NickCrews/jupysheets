    // By default, jupyterlite saves the state of the notebook to the client's
    // browser, and on reload of the page, the notebook will be restored to that state.
    // The problem is that this local state overrides the contents sent from the server.
    // So, if you edit a notebook rebuild your docs, and refresh the page,
    // you still see the old version.
    // These settings make it so that the state is never stored on the client,
    // and is refreshed from the server on every page load.
    // Not ideal: it would be great if the user's state persisted until the
    // data on the server actually *changed*, but that doesn't appear possible yet.
