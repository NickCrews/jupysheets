Use https://github.com/jtpio/ipylab to support sending commands programmatically from python to the jupyterlab frontend

I'm not sure yet how to wire this up to [jupyter-iframe-commands](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/jupyter-iframe-commands)
so that the command then gets forwarded through the iframe boundary to the host js.
